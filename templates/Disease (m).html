                            <div class="panel-body">Acne is a skin condition that occurs when your hair follicles
                                become plugged with oil and dead skin cells. It causes whiteheads, blackheads or
                                pimples.
                                Acne is most common among teenagers, though it affects people of all ages.

                                Effective acne treatments are available, but acne can be persistent. The pimples and
                                bumps
                                heal slowly, and when one begins to go away, others seem to crop up.

                                Depending on its severity, acne can cause emotional distress and scar the skin. The
                                earlier
                                you start treatment, the lower your risk of such problems.

                            <div class="panel-body">Allergies occur when your immune system reacts to a foreign
                                substance — such as pollen, bee venom or pet dander — or a food that doesn't cause a
                                reaction in most people.

                                Your immune system produces substances known as antibodies. When you have allergies,
                                your immune system makes antibodies that identify a particular allergen as harmful,
                                even though it isn't. When you come into contact with the allergen, your immune
                                system's reaction can inflame your skin, sinuses, airways or digestive system.

                                The severity of allergies varies from person to person and can range from minor
                                irritation to anaphylaxis — a potentially life-threatening emergency. While most
                                allergies can't be cured, treatments can help relieve your allergy symptoms.</div>

                                differs from the term "side effect" because side effects can be beneficial as well

                                several parts of the body. A jock with athlete’s foot, a baby with thrush, and a
                                woman with a vaginal yeast infection are just a few examples.

                                Fungi are microorganisms characterized by a substance in their cell walls called
                                chitin. Some fungi, like many types of mushrooms, are edible. Other types of fungi,
                                like aspergillus, can be extremely dangerous and lead to life-threatening diseases.

                                Different types of fungi can cause fungal infections. In some cases, fungi that
                                aren’t typically found on or inside your body can colonize it and cause an
                                infection. In other cases, fungi that are normally present on or inside your body
                                can multiply out of control and cause an infection.

                                Fungal infections can be contagious. They can spread from one person to another. In
                                some cases, you can also catch disease-causing fungi from infected animals or
                                contaminated soil or surfaces.

                                If you develop signs or symptoms of a fungal infection, make an appointment with
                                your doctor.</div>
